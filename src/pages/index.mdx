# Welcome

- **Note**: Reference  [MDX Technology ](/links) for more information about the technologies  used to build this site.

This web site is testing MDX components. MDX is markdown for the component era. MDX enables embedding JSX inside markdown. It enables using  markdownâ€™s terse syntax (such as # heading) with JSX components

Before MDX, the benefits of writing Markdown were lost when integrating with JSX. Implementations were template string-based which required lots of escaping and cumbersome syntax. It was tedious and error prone.


MDX enables seamlessly writing JSX in Markdown documents. Components can be used to embed interactive charts, alerts, and many other components within MDX content
