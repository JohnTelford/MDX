# About

Since the early days of the web, I have been building web sites learning about the  technologies du jour by building.

The web has been a part of my life since its early days. I have years of learning by hands-on experience with the ever changing Electronics, Internet, and Software technologies, and a passion pursuing what’s new and improved with these industries.

Checking out what’s new or not, or a pipe dream or not, or what’s new and improved, is like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily, every so often one finds  nuggets making the effort worthwhile.
